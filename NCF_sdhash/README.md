Note: Code adapted from sdhash 3.4 (https://github.com/sdhash/sdhash). Changes performed only in file sdbf/sdbf_core.cc. Updated file available here.

Using NCF_sdhash:

	1. Extract sdhash-3.4.zip.
	2. Change sdbf_core.cc file available here for the one of sdhash original code in the sdbf folder.
	3. In sdbf_core.cc file, update the database path (with the path of your database) and the N value (controlling the number of times a feature must repeat in order to be considered common).
	4. Compile the code using the makefile.


The commands for operating NCF_sdhash are the same of the original sdhash.
